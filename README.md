- 👋 Hi i am Neil I'm a passionate MERN stack developer with expertise in building robust and scalable web applications.
  My journey in software development began in highshool. Since then, I've been dedicated to honing my skills
  and staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies.

- 👨‍💻 Technical Skills:
- Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Redux, Bootstrap
- Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB, MySQL
- Testing: Jest, Enzyme
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

- 🌟 Highlights of my experience:
- Developed and deployed several MERN stack applications, showcasing my ability to handle the full development cycle from conceptualization to deployment.
- Built responsive and user-friendly front-end interfaces using React.js and implemented state management with Redux for efficient data flow.
- Created RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js, ensuring smooth communication between the front-end and back-end components.
- Designed and managed MongoDB and MySQL databases, implementing efficient data models and query optimization techniques.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams and utilized Agile methodologies (Scrum) to deliver high-quality projects within deadlines.

- 🔭 Currently, I'm exploring web 3 and blockchain technologies. I'm fascinated by the potential of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum.
-  I'm familiarizing myself with Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts,
   and learning about decentralized storage, identity management, and other web 3 concepts.
